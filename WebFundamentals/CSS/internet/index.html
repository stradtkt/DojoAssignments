  <h3>Clients and Servers</h3>
  <p>Computers connected to the Web are called <b>clients</b> and <b>servers</b></p>
  <ul>
    <li><span>Clients</span> are the typical Web user's Internet-connected devices (for example, your computer connected to your Wi-Fi, or your phone connected to your mobile network) 
      and <span class="blue">Web-accessing software available on those devices (usually a web browser like Firefox or Chrome).</span>
    </li>
    <li><span>Servers</span> 
      are computers that store webpages, sites, or apps.  When a client device wants to access a webpage, a copy of the webpage 
      is downloaded from the server onto the client machine to be displayed in the user's web browser
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>So What Actually Happens?</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      The browser goes to the <span>DNS server</span> and finds the real address of the <span>server</span> that the website lives on.
    </li>
    <li>
      The browser sends an <span>HTTP request</span> message to the server asking it to send a copy of the website to the client
    </li>
    <li>
      If the server approves the client's request, the server sends the client a <span>"200 OK" message</span>, which 
      means "Permission granted! Here you go!", and then starts sending the website's files to the browser as a series of small chunks.
    </li>
    <li>
      The browser assembles the small chunks into a complete website and displays it to you!
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3>The Big 3 - HTML, CSS, JavaScript</h3>
  <p>While the server can process information in many different languages, the files 
    that they serve to the client are always going to be some combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript!
