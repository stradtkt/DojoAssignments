            <h3>Clients and Servers</h3>
            <p>Computers connected to the <span>Web</span> are called <b>clients</b> and <b>servers</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li><span>Clients</span> are the typical Web user's Internet-connected devices (for example, your computer connected to your Wi-Fi, or your phone connected to your mobile network) 
                and <span class="blue">Web-accessing software</span> available on those devices (usually a web browser like Firefox or Chrome).
              </li>
              <li><span>Servers</span> 
                are computers that store <span>webpages</span>, <span>sites</span>, or <span>apps</span>.  When a client device wants to access a webpage, a copy of the webpage 
                is downloaded from the server onto the client machine to be displayed in the user's web browser

            <h3>So What Actually Happens?</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>
                The browser goes to the <span>DNS server</span> and finds the real address of the <span>server</span> that the website lives on.
              </li>
              <li>
                The browser sends an <span>HTTP request</span> message to the server asking it to send a copy of the website to the client
              </li>
              <li>
                If the server approves the client's request, the server sends the client a <span>"200 OK" message</span>, which 
                means "Permission granted! Here you go!", and then starts sending the website's files to the browser as a series of small chunks.
              </li>
              <li>
                The browser assembles the small chunks into a complete website and displays it to you!
              </li>
            </ol>

                <h3>The Big 3 - HTML, CSS, JavaScript</h3>
                <p>While the server can process information in many different languages, the files 
                that they serve to the client are always going to be some combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript!
