    <h3>JavaScript Basics</h3>
    <p>
        JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-orientated scripting language.  JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons.  
        It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions.
        JavaScript lives inside a host environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these evironments
        to provide programmatic control over them.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#">Variable Declaration</a>  JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee,
         the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value.  All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names.  These unique names are 
         called identifiers, var x;
      </li>
      <li><a href="#">Variable Assignment</a>  
        Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our 
        variable a value to hold.  The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable, var x = 10;
      </li>
      <li><a href="#">Data Types</a>
        Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know that data type.  There are six
         data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean - true or false; null - null aka nothing; Number - 42 or 3.14159;
          String - "Coding Dojo Rocks!";  Array [1, 'Coding', 2, 'Dojo']; and Object - {first_name: 'Jane', last_name: 'Doe'}
      </li>
      <li><a href="#">Conditionals</a>
        When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on 
        values or conditions that have been met.  You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this.  There 
        are the following conditional statements: if a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; else if to specify a new condition 
        to test, if the first condition is false; else we execute this block of code;
      </li>
      <li><a href="#">Loops</a>
        There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they 
        will repeat an action some number of times.  Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times 
        and then you stop.  Thats a loop!
      </li>
      <li><a href="#">Function</a>
        Functions are an encapsulation of a code block.  When we call our function this will run that code block.  Think of it 
        as a list of instructions.  As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, 
        first we screw the legs top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there 
        are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and over and over again.
